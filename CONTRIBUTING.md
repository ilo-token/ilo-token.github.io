# Contributing

You can do the usual github stuff: Open issue if there's an issue or you have a suggestion; Open pull request if you want to propose changes.

Unless you want to edit the dictionary in `./src/dictionary.ts` or it is just a small edit e.g. a typo fix, please claim an issue first or open a new issue and claim it before working on the code. This is to avoid duplicate efforts.

If you want to edit the dictionary, just go ahead and contribute! We provide useful guidelines in the wiki!
