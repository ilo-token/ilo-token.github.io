# Contributing

You can do the usual github stuff: Open issue if there's an issue or you have a suggestion; Open pull request if you want to propose changes. If you want to propose a large change however, please open an issue first (or comment on an already existing issue page), and wait for my signal before beginning to work.

## The wiki

The wiki provides useful information for contributors, although it's not complete yet. Check it out: [Visit wiki](https://github.com/neverRare/toki-pona-translator/wiki).
