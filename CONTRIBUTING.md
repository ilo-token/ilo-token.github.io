# Contributing

You can do the usual github stuff: Open issue if there's an issue or you have a suggestion; Open pull request if you want to propose changes.

Unless you want to edit the dictionary in `./src/dictionary.ts`, please claim an issue first, or open a new issue and claim it, before working on the code. This is to avoid duplicate efforts.

## The wiki

The wiki provides useful information for contributors, although it's not complete yet. Check it out: [Visit wiki](https://github.com/neverRare/ilo-token/wiki).
