## 0.4.0 (On development)

The latest on-development version can be accessed by building the source code.
On this on-development version, things can be broken.

ilo Token now has custom dictionary editor! This allows users to customize the
dictionary to their liking. Users can customize existing words and also extend
ilo Token with more non-pu words. It comes with limitations however.
[Read the guidelines for using custom dictionary editor](https://github.com/ilo-token/ilo-token.github.io/wiki/Guidelines-for-editing-dictionary).

Some of the settings may reset. Please reconfigure it again to your liking.
Sorry for the inconvenience. We've decided to reset some of the settings after
refactoring to make the code easier to work with.

- Implement custom dictionary editor.
- Fixed "la" translation.
- Consecutive adverbs are now not shown to avoid ambiguity.
- Sentences ending with long string of punctuation such as "â€¦" and "!?" are now
  recognized.
- Interpunct or middle dot (Â·) and ideographic period (ã€‚) are now recognized as
  sentence separator.
- Recognize multiline text. Newlines are either ignored or treated as sentence
  terminator.
- New setting called multiline input mode. This enables users to insert newline
  on the text box. Ctrl + Enter is used to start translation.
- Fixed UCSUR rendering.
- Fixed ordering issue in Firefox. Thanks akesi Ale!
- Implement advanced parsing settings.
- Long texts (>500) are no longer recognized.

## 0.3.0

Released 15 Aug 2024

This is a huge update now with better quality translations, configurable
settings, UCSUR support, and expanded vocabulary!

- Reimplement the word "a". This were dropped due to parser rewrite.
- The vocabulary has been expanded to _nimi ku suli_ plus _nimi su!_.
- New "dictionary mode", just enter a single word and ilo Token will output all
  definition from its own dictionary. This also works for particles. To bypass
  this and translate the word as if it is the whole sentence, just add a period.
- Implement UCSUR support! It supports:
  - Cartouche with nasin sitelen kalama
  - Combined glyphs
  - Long glyphs
  - (Deprecated characters and combiners are not supported)
- Implement [nasin nanpa pona](https://sona.pona.la/wiki/nasin_nanpa_pona).
- Implement
  [settings dialog](https://github.com/ilo-token/ilo-token.github.io/wiki/Settings-Help).
- Changes in error messages:
  - All possible errors will now be listed.
  - ilo Token now uses telo misikeke for error messages. This can be disabled
    from the settings.
- Multiline text will no longer be recognized.
- Add icons.

You may not notice this, we take good grammar for granted, but ilo Token now has
generally better quality translations thanks to the following:

- It is now aware determiners are separate from adjectives. So you won't see
  adjectives like "nicely my", since adverbs can't modify determiners.
- It tries to ensure adjectives are in proper order. Yes this matters, it's "big
  red fruit" and not "red big fruit".
- Just like adjectives, determiners are also ordered, but unlike adjectives,
  they're also filtered (some combinations are not shown). You won't see "my
  your animal".
- It is aware of grammatical numbers. So you won't see "2 stick" or "1 sticks".

Inside update (intended for developers):

- Implement lexer and english AST.
- Overhaul dictionary: It is now a separate file with nicer syntax as opposed to
  written inside the code.
