## Starting development server

After using `git clone`, you'll need [Deno](https://deno.com/) for this project.
Then you'll need to install the dependencies before running any command:
`deno install --frozen`.

After this, you can start away by running `deno task start` then open
`./dist/index.html` using your favorite browser. The server will automatically
rebuild the project. However, you need to manually refresh the page.

Run `deno task` to see more useful command lines.
